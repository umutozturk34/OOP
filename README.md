# Polygon System with OOP in C#

This project demonstrates the use of object-oriented programming (OOP) principles in C# by creating a system that handles polygon generation and rotation. It's a clean and structured example of how to use classes, inheritance, and encapsulation in a geometric context.

## 📐 Overview

The application allows the creation of polygons (e.g., triangles, squares, etc.) and applies rotation transformations to them.

Key features include:
- Polygon creation with any number of sides
- Customizable coordinates
- Rotation by a specified angle
- Use of classes and OOP principles (e.g., `Polygon`, `Point`, transformation logic)

## 🧠 Concepts Demonstrated

- ✅ Classes and Objects  
- ✅ Encapsulation  
- ✅ Inheritance  
- ✅ Constructors & Properties  
- ✅ Geometry and Transformations  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- C# (.NET)
- Console Application (CLI)
- Visual Studio (recommended IDE)

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/umutozturk34/OOP.git
